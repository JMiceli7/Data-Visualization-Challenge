# Data-Visualization-Challenge

This is a repo containing files for Module 5: Data Visualization. 

The data folder contains csv files of a completed study by Pharmaceuticals Inc. 

The pymaceuticals_starter.ipynb file contains code in which the two cvs files are merged together, forming one file summary of the completed the study. 

The file is then cleaned by renaming columns, deleting duplicate entries, and forming a more legible dataframe. 

At this point, several visualizations including bar and pie charts, as well as linear regression statistical analyses are completed to better see and understand the collected data.
